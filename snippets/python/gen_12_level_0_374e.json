  "code": "Here's a simple yet elegant and efficient Python function to check if a word is a palindrome:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(word: str) -> bool:\n    # Normalize the word by converting to lowercase\n    normalized = word.lower()\n    # Check if the normalized word reads the same forwards and backwards\n    return normalized == normalized[::-1]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- We convert the word to lowercase to ensure the check is case-insensitive.\n- We use Python's slice notation `[::-1]` to reverse the string efficiently.\n- Then we simply compare the normalized string with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```python\nprint(is_palindrome(\"Radar\"))  # True\nprint(is_palindrome(\"Python\")) # False\n```\n\nIf you'd like, I can also provide a version that ignores spaces and punctuation for a more generalized palindrome check!",

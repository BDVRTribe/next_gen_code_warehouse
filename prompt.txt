**Title:**
Autonomous Robotic Ecological Restoration System (ARES)

**Domain:**
Sustainability and Environmental Science

**Objective:**
To create an autonomous robotic system that uses AI to restore various ecosystems by identifying degraded areas, selecting appropriate native plant species for revitalization, and then planting and monitoring the progress over time.

**Experiment Description:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Use drones and satellite imagery to collect data on deforested areas, eroded landscapes, or regions with declining biodiversity.
   - Leverage environmental data, including soil quality, humidity, local climate, and existing plant species.

2. **Machine Learning Model Development:**
   - Develop ML models to analyze the environmental data for pattern recognition and predict which areas require intervention.
   - Train models to identify the best native species for specific ecological conditions.

3. **Robot Design:**
   - Design autonomous planting robots that navigate terrain and care for flora post-deployment.

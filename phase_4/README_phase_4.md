# 🧬 Phase 4 – AI Code Evolution Chamber

## 📌 Purpose

To build a trial-and-error code generation system where AI can:
- Interpret a prompt or goal.
- Generate initial candidate code.
- Test the code in a safe sandbox.
- Analyze results and errors.
- Mutate or optimize the code.
- Iterate until a successful output is achieved.

## 🧱 Core Modules

| File                     | Purpose                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `objective_parser.py`    | Converts prompts into structured execution goals          |
| `code_synthesizer.py`    | Generates candidate code using AI/GPT                     |
| `sandbox_runner.py`      | Executes code safely and captures output/errors           |
| `feedback_evaluator.py`  | Evaluates performance, correctness, and fitness           |
| `mutation_engine.py`     | Applies intelligent modifications to the candidate code   |
| `fitness_tracker.py`     | Tracks improvement across iterations                      |
| `chamber_core.py`        | Orchestrates the full lifecycle of generation and testing |

## 🧪 MVP Goals

- Accept structured prompt (e.g., `"write a function that reverses a string"`).
- Generate Python code (via `code_synthesizer.py`).
- Run code in a sandbox and capture output.
- Score performance (pass/fail or partial).
- Modify input code and retry.

---

## 🔐 Safety & Ethics

- No internet access inside sandbox
- Execution time and memory limits
- Logs stored to `undo_logs/` for rollback

---

## 🧠 Future Potential

- Use RL/Q-learning to guide code mutation paths
- Enable multi-objective synthesis (performance + style)
- Explore AGI-style self-improving intelligence
